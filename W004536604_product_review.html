    <li> <strong> Ellen </strong>  <br> Rated 5 out of 5 stars. 09/19/2023 <br> I absolutely love my new Pink Velvet chair. It's well made and so very pretty </li>
    <li> <strong> Hollie </strong> <br> Rated 4 out of 5 stars. 08/13/2023 <br> This chair is adorable! It was very simple to put together & feels sturdy. I am excited to use it!</li>
    <li>  <strong> Anonymous </strong> <br> Rated 2 out of 5 stars. 01/12/2023 <br> DONT BUY THIS- Original review I’m so obsessed! Comfortable chair, affordable, vibrant color. I live in a small apartment so wanted a chair the could work as a desk chair and extra seating for guests. It’s big enough for my 25lb dog to nap in it! EDIT this chair literally broke apart underneath me while I was in a zoom meeting.  </li>
