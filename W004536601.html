		<p> 
		SKU: W004536601 <br> This accent chair delivers a retro silhouette paired with some coastal flair to your living room or den - and is sure to become a favorite reading or movie-watching chair. It has a frame made from kiln-dried solid and engineered wood and stands on turned legs in a wood tone. Integrated pocket springs provide support and help prevent sagging over time. What's more, the slightly slanted back and flared arms lend a stylish look while providing comfort. Striped upholstery (which we love for its beachy look!) wraps around comfy foam cushioning. Partner this armchair with a floor lamp to shed a little light on your book of the moment.
